# Description

This project, developed for an image processing course, explores the use of neural networks to perform complex feature extraction on image data, contrasting its effectiveness with logistic regression. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the team aims to capture intricate details within images that simpler models, like logistic regression, might miss. A significant focus is placed on handling data imbalances through oversampling using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to enhance the model's fairness and accuracy. Extensive experimentation was conducted with hyperparameter tuning in neural networks, optimizing parameters such as the number of hidden layers, neurons, and activation functions. The project showcases improvements in predictive accuracy after tuning and provides insights into how neural networks can outperform traditional models in complex feature extraction, making it a valuable study in applying machine learning to image processing.
